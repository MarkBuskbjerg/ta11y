## AlpineJS

All interactive elements are handled with AlpineJS. AlpineJS is a lightweight alternative to VueJS.

This gives you a double-whammy advantage. First of all you get to enjoy the speed of building your page with a lightweight framework such as Alpine.js. But it also means that you will easily be able to rewrite and replace AlpineJS with
VueJS if you need to later on in your project.
